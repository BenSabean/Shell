Currently Implemented:
  -Successfully runs programs in the /bin directory. 
    (use "ls /bin" to see all runable programs)
  -can pass argument(s) to programs in /bin directory.
    (e.g. ls -l)
  -implemented built-in function exit.
  -created function stub for built-in function cd and shell recognizes it
   as a built-in function.
  -Added /usr/bin/ as another path to search.
  -Added Username, Host name and current directory to command prompt. 

TODO:
  -Don't display redundant information on the current directory in the
   command prompt.
    (e.g. display everything after /osxxxxxx/ on newCS)
  -clear screen at start-up of shell and display a welcome message.
  -display a logout message.
  -define built-in function cd.
  -create built-in function help.
  -listen for arrow keys to move around user's input.
  -Allow programs to be run using ./<program_name>
